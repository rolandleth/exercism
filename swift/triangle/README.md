# Triangle

Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds or 
is equal to the length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle
inequality_.
